# E-Collab

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª&nbsp;Introduction
Built a platform to practice code and find a project based on your skills and interests.

## üî≠&nbsp;About this Project
A simple web platform where anyone can directly write code to learn and practice in over 5+ most popular languages and also a Project admin who's looking to hire people according to skill requirement would simply provide description of the project including tech stack so that a person willing to collaborate can connect with admin.

## üéØ&nbsp;Solution Novelty
It has been observed that sometimes a coder just need a code editor which is available to them everytime so that they can do some coding stuff instantly from anywhere so here is the code editor for web. Also there are two types of tech enthusiasts first are the one who look for teammates for their next project and the other side there are people who look for projects based on their skill set to work on, this platform is made to solve this issue.

## ü§ù&nbsp;Social Impact
There are many peoples who love coding but they if they do not have thier pc setup to practice and there are many IT professionals and individuals who want to build project for their resume. So it will definitely help them alot by taking their skills , experience and all the other information to the Right Person. Thus establishing the connection between project admin and skilled individual.

## üß≠&nbsp;Future Objective
 - To add support of more languages and for practicing purpose we might have some coding problems right here on this paltform.
 - To give various functionality for collaboration between IT people like comment section,chat etc.

## üìó&nbsp;Learning Outcomes

 - Full Stack Development
 - Deployment to Cloud

_**Would be happy if someone else also found this useful and want to add any other feature in it**_
