## Topics:
### Linux fundamentals for Devops.
1. Fundamentals 
- Linux Distributions
- Linux Architecture
- Uses of Linux
3. Basic Commands
4. System Adminstration
- User and Groups, File Permissions, Logs, Monitoring etc. 
## Prerequisites:
- No prerequisites, as everything is from basics.
**Note:** This tutorial will not cover advanced topics.
## Important Points:
- Most important points of this lecture.

## Topic: 
- **Linux**: Linux operating systems are open source operating systems run on linux kernel. It has GUI/CLI capabilities where most of the people prefer CLI  to use linux based os.
- **Kernel**: A kernel is like brain of operating system which helps in managing all this functions like process management, file management, memory management etc, Linux Kernel is monolithic in nature. Linux Kernel was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).
- Linux is made up of GNU (collection of free softwares like compilers, debuggers etc.) and kernel that's why it is called as GNU/Linux OS.

### Linux Distributions
Categories of Linux distro on basis of **package mangement**
1. RPM Package Manager (yum/dnf)
- Red Hat Linux
- Centos
- Fedora
- Rocky Linux
- SUSE Linux
2. Debian Based (apt)
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Elementry OS
- Parrot
- Kali Linux
3. Pacman Based (pacman)
- Arch Linux
- Monjaro

these are the most popular one also there are Conary Based and Source Based distro exists.

### Linux Architecture
At the bottom there is a **Hardware Layer** where things like CPU, Disks, Devices, RAM etc lies and these are controlled by a program/software i.e. **Kernel** and above this there are number of **System Calls(Syscalls)** like read, write, exec, create, chown, chmod etc which tells the kernel to perform above mentioned functions. Then comes **Programs** like grep, ls, cp, rm etc and these comes under GNU part, Now there comes a **Shell** to which we tell to perform tasks on kernel like bash, zsh etc. Upto this is for CLI and for GUI there are some more layers.

### Uses of Linux OS
Linux OS is used widely around many areas like 
- Personal computers
- Servers
- Mobile phone(Andriod)
- Embedded devices (watches, lights etc)
## To study
Try to learn the following comparisions and topics.
- Linux v/s Unix based OS.
- Kernel Code v/s Non Kernel Code.
- GUI v/s CLI
- Shell v/s Terminal
- Distribution based on various cateogries like package mangment, process management etc.
